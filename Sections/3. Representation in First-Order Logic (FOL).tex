\section{Representation in First-Order Logic (FOL)}
\begin{large}
    Consider the following baseball vocabulary:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $Pitcher(p)$ is a predicate where person $p$ is a pitcher.
        \item $flies(p_1, p_2)$ is a predicate where person $p_1$ flies\footnote{A flyout occurs when a batter hits the ball in the air, and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground.} out to person $p_2$.
        \item $Centerfielder(p)$ is a predicate where person $p$ is a centerfielder.
        \item $scores(p)$ is a predicate where person $p$ scores.
        \item $friend(p_1, p_2)$ is a predicate where person $p_1$ is the friend of person $p_2$ (but not vice versa).
        \item Robinson, Crabb, Samson, Jones are constants denoting persons.
    \end{enumerate}
    Now look at the following translations of natural language into first order logic statements describing
    a baseball game. Using the provided vocabulary, translate the conclusion of each of the
    following arguments into an FOL statement.
\end{large}

\subsection{Argument A}
\begin{large}
    Only pitchers fly out to Robinson. Crabb scores only if Samson flies out to Robinson and Robinson is a
    centerfielder. Crabb scores.
    Conclusion: Samson is a pitcher.\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x : [flies(x, Robinson) \rightarrow P itcher(x)]$
        \item $scores(Crabb) \rightarrow (flies(Samson, Robinson) \lor Centerf ielder(Robinson))$
        \item $scores(Crabb)$
    \end{itemize}

\end{large}


\subsection{Argument B}
\begin{large}
    No centerfielder who does not score has any friends. Robinson and Jones are both centerfielders. Any
    centerfielder who flies out to Jones does not score. Robinson flies out to Jones.
    Conclusion: Jones is not a friend of Robinson.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x : [(Centerfielder(x) \lor \neg scores(x)) \rightarrow \neg \exists y : [friend(y, x)]]$
        \item $Centerfielder(Robinson) \lor Centerfielder(Jones)$
        \item $\forall x : [(Centerfielder(x) \lor flies(x, Jones)) \rightarrow \neg scores(x)]$
        \item $flies(Robinson, Jones)$
    \end{itemize}
    Square brackets [] are used to stress which parts of the statement belong under which quantifier.
